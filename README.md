# Navigating the Skies: Data-Driven Entry Strategy for Aviation Sector

## Project Overview
This project aims to establish a strategic foothold in the rapidly growing Indian aviation market through a data-driven entry strategy. By leveraging advanced SQL analytics, we develop comprehensive pricing recommendations to aid emerging airlines in identifying optimal entry price points amidst dynamic market conditions.

## Objective
Our core objective is to devise a versatile pricing framework tailored to diverse traveler profiles and journey patterns. We process extensive datasets, including flight bookings, fares, airport data, and demographic information, to provide actionable insights that facilitate informed decision-making on pricing strategies, route planning, and operational tactics.

## Dataset Description
- `travel_info.csv`: Flight times, source, destination, fares, and related metrics across India.
- `airports.csv`: Data on Indian airports including infrastructure and operational details.
- `airlines.csv`: Information about Indian airlines and their flight codes.
- `place.csv`: Demographic profiles of Indian cities contributing to market analysis and strategy formulation.

## Analysis
The methodology includes:
- Scouring various websites for necessary data and normalizing the data.
- Determining key entities and interrelations using business expertise and translating these into an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
- Developing the database using MySQL, employing SQL techniques such as advanced joins, aggregations, and window functions to extract meaningful insights.
- Analyzing competitive pricing strategies, airport traffic, and demographic data to optimize operational planning.

## Key Findings
- Insights into economy class pricing and competitor fare analysis.
- Analysis of popular destinations from source airports and ranking airports based on various factors.
